Project Overview:
This classification model is designed to analyze automobile theft incidents and predict outcomes or categorize events based on various features, including the time taken to report the theft. The objective is to extract patterns from the dataset to assist law enforcement agencies and city planners in understanding, preventing, and responding to auto thefts more effectively.

Objective:
To classify auto theft incidents based on factors such as reporting delay, location, time of day, and other contextual features â€” and potentially predict theft risk or reporting behavior.

Dataset Features (commonly found in such datasets):
Although the contents are not yet reviewed, typical features include:

Occurrence Date/Time

Report Date/Time

Time to Report (calculated in hours or days)

Location Info (e.g., neighborhood, postal code)

Vehicle Make/Model/Year

Theft Category (e.g., from driveway, public road, garage)

Status (e.g., stolen, recovered, unrecovered)

Weather or Time-of-day Info (morning, night, etc.)

Target Variable: Time_to_Report_hours
